Web-based qttt game written in javascript. Computer moves are fetched from backend. After the game is over, game data is sent to server where it is stored in database. In a seperate process, we use RapidMiner to further train selected ML models with new data (the idea was that this RapidMiner integrtion would allow for quick hands-on experimentation). Model parameters are updated and saved in database. In the future, moves predicted by winning strategies are returned to client more often. After some time, winning ML model is to be implemented on frontend and used as a heuristic function in combination with classical minimax search.
